Software project failure
------------------------

- Project does not meet requirements (poor quality)
- Behind schedule
- Cost overrun

Software Engineering: the process of establishing sound and effective engineering
methodologies, processes, and tools for developing software in high-quality, on-time,
and within the budget.

Challenges
----------

- Software processes and artifacts are very difficult to visualize
  - Diagrams for architechture, requirements / specifications, data structures, UI, ..., everything
- Size of software is big
- Complexity of software is high
- Volatile environment(s)
  - Technologies advance rapidly

  
Software Life Cycle Models
--------------------------

- Waterfall ( can go back to any step at any time if there is need )
  Communication -> Planning -> Modeling -> Construction -> Deployment

Events in the Software Life Cycle
---------------------------------

Communication
=============
  - Project initiation
  - Requirements gathering

Planning
========
  - Scoping
  - Estimate cost and effort
  - Scheduling

Modeling
========
  - Requirements modeling
  - Design

Construction
============
  - coding
  - testing

Deployment
==========
  - Deliver
  - Installatio
